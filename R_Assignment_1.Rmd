## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Before starting this assignment, make sure that you have read **Getting Started with R**. I assume that you have downloaded R and RStudio and that you know how to import an Excel file. 

1. Import the USG data file into a data frame (table) and label it myData. Keep in mind that The R language is case sensitive. 

```{r}
# Type your code here. I already typed your first code here, but you need to replace the path (C:/Users/flee/Documents/USG.xlsx) in which the directory your file is saved. 
# R will not run any code after the # sign. Text after # are meant to be comments you use to explain what the code is doing.

library(readxl)
myData <- read_excel("C:/Users/54208/Google Drive/School/Graduate School/Masters/Fall 2021/DataMining/USG.xlsx")
View(myData)

```


2.	Use the dim function in R to count the number of observations and variables. You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r}
dim(myData)

```

3. View the first few rows of myData with head command function. Using the View command to open up a different tab with myData

```{r}
head(myData)
View(myData)
```
4. Checking to see which values are na for myData's Industry column
```{r}
is.na(myData$Industry)

```
5. Identifying which rows in myData's Industry column contain NA values
```{r}
which(is.na(myData$Industry))

```
6. Checking the number of rows that are in the automotive industry
```{r}
length(which(myData$Industry == 'Automotive'))
```
7. Checking the number of rows that have an hourly wage greater than 30
```{r}
length(which(myData$HourlyWage > 30))
```
8. Checking the number of rows that meet both conditions of being in the automotive industry and having an hourly wage greater than 30 an hour
```{r}
length(which(myData$Industry=='Automotive' & myData$HourlyWage > 30))
```
9. Sorting the data based on hourly wage and assigning it to the sortedData1 variable
```{r}
sortedData1 <- myData[order(myData$HourlyWage),]
View(sortedData1)


```
10. Sorting myData based on hourly wage descending and assigning it to sortedData1 
```{r}
sortedData1 <- myData[order(myData$HourlyWage, decreasing = TRUE),]

```
11.Sorting the data on multiple columns: Inudstry, Job, and Hourly wage and then assigning it to sortedData2 and viewing the new sorted data.
```{r}
sortedData2 <- myData[order(myData$Industry,myData$Job,myData$HourlyWage),]
View(sortedData2)
```
12.Sorting myData by Industry, Job in ascending order while sorrting Hourly Wage in descending order and assigning the sorted data to sortedData3
```{r}
sortedData3 <- myData[order(myData$Industry, myData$Job, -myData$HourlyWage),]
View(sortedData3)
```
13. Using the xtfrm function on the Industry column in order to sort it descending and sorting the other columns like Job and Hourly wage and assigning it to sortedData4
```{r}
sortedData4 <- myData[order(-xtfrm(myData$Industry), myData$Job,
myData$HourlyWage),]
View(sortedData4)
```
14. Sorting myData by industry, job, and hourly wage and making them all sort descending and saving the dataset as sortedData5
```{r}
sortedData5 <- myData[order(myData$Industry, myData$Job, myData$HourlyWage,
decreasing = TRUE),]
View(sortedData5)

```
15. Saving the sortedData5 dataset as a csv file.
```{r}
write.csv(sortedData5,"sortedData5.csv")
```
